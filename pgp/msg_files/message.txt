Hello this akshat biniwale, hello aryaman chokhani.
This is the lab for CSS and we are currently on the 7th experiment of the lab session. Below is a secret message - 

"A Stack is an abstract linear data structure serving as a collection of
elements that are inserted (push operation) and removed (pop
operation) according to the Last in First Out (LIFO) approach.
Insertion and deletion happen on the same end (top) in a Stack. The
top of the stack is returned using the peek operation."
